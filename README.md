## Description

This project was created as a way to try out a basic full stack application using Bcrypt, Sequelize and Express. There were many hurdles along the way, not the least of which was time. The goal for the project was to make a tech blog word press style app that could create users and allow for posts to be made. 

## Installation

There are no installations required to use this application. Use the deployed link above to access the app.

## Usage
Test login: test@test.com  password: password

To use the application, follow the link above to the deployed page on Heroku. There, users can make an account and start posting blog entries about technologies that are of interest to them.
